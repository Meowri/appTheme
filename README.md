## App Theme-TEMPLATE

This project was build in order to develop better skills on HTML 5 semantics and responsive HTML/CSS design.

Furthermore, the idea is to spread the concept of branching in GIT, so each step of the project was build in a new branch.

The project was build with 11 branches + master branch, each branch related with one feature of the website. All the branches were merged on master by pull request with no fast-forward process. To follow up the process it was created 11 issues, one related with each branch development and six milestones, related with blocks of improvements on the website. Everything was organized in a project that automatically set the issues as to do / in process / done.
